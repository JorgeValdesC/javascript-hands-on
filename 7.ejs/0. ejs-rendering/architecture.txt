Destructuring and Renaming
const { name: firstName, age: yearsOld, favoriteColor: color } = user;
Destructure properties from the user object.
Rename:
name → firstName
age → yearsOld
favoriteColor → color
This makes variable names more descriptive and avoids conflicts in the EJS template.


Rendering with EJS
res.render("user", { firstName, yearsOld, color });
Pass the destructured variables (firstName, yearsOld, color) to the EJS template.


Route Handling
app.get("/user/:id", (req, res) => { ... });
:id captures a dynamic part of the URL (e.g., /user/1).
req.params.id retrieves the value (1 in this case).


Descriptive Variable Names:

Renaming via destructuring makes the code and templates more readable.
Dynamic Content:

The route dynamically renders different user profiles.
Clean Separation:

Data (users), logic (app.js), and presentation (user.ejs) are separated.
Styling Option:

Includes a simple way to add CSS.

fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly
Everything up-to-date

The error message you're seeing is often related to large files or a large number of changes being pushed to the remote repository. To resolve this, you can increase the Git buffer size. Here's how to do it:

Solution: Increase the Git Buffer Size
Run the following command to increase the buffer size:

git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
Explanation:
http.postBuffer: Controls the buffer size for HTTP requests in Git.
524288000: Sets the buffer size to 500 MB (524,288,000 bytes). This allows Git to handle larger files or large packs of changes during a push.

Steps to Apply the Fix:
Run the command to increase the buffer size: git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
Retry the push: git push origin main

Other Potential Fixes
If increasing the buffer size doesn't work, consider these additional solutions:

1. Check Your Internet Connection
A slow or unstable connection can cause the push to fail. Retry when your connection is stable.
2. Split Your Changes
If you're pushing a very large set of changes, try splitting it into smaller commits:
git push origin main
3. Ensure Remote Repository Space
If you're using a service like GitHub or GitLab, check that your repository hasn't hit storage limits.
4. Verbose Output for Debugging
Enable verbose mode to see more details about the push operation:
GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1 GIT_TRACE=1 GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 git push origin main


Summary
The most common and effective solution for this issue is:

git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000

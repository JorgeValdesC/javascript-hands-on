## **What is Node.js?**

### **Definition**
- **Node.js** is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser.
- It’s built on Google Chrome’s **V8 JavaScript Engine**, making it fast and efficient.

### **Key Features**
1. **Non-blocking I/O**:
   - Handles multiple requests simultaneously without waiting for one to complete.
2. **Event-driven architecture**:
   - Reacts to events (like HTTP requests) efficiently.
3. **Server-side execution**:
   - Allows JavaScript to handle backend tasks, like accessing databases or serving APIs.

## **What is Express?**

### **Definition**
- **Express** is a minimal and flexible **web application framework** for Node.js.
- It provides tools to build web servers and APIs quickly and efficiently.

### **Why Use Express?**
- Simplifies routing and middleware management.
- Scales well with large applications.
- Supports a massive ecosystem of plugins for tasks like authentication, validation, and logging.
